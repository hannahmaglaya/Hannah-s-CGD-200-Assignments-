Great! I see you've already created a GitHub repository called Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-. Now let’s walk through the steps to organize and upload your two assignment websites into this single repository.

🧭 Step-by-Step Guide to Upload Two Websites into One GitHub Repository
1. Organize Your Local Files
Before uploading, make sure your two websites are in separate folders:


Copy
Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/
├── Assignment1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── Assignment2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
└── README.md
2. Add a README.md (Optional but Recommended)
This file explains what your repository is about. You can edit the existing one or create a new one:

markdown

Copy
# Hannah's CGD 200 Assignments

This repository contains two web development assignments:

- **Assignment 1**: [Brief description]
- **Assignment 2**: [Brief description]
3. Upload Files to GitHub
You can do this in two ways:

🔹 Option A: Using GitHub Website
Go to your repository: Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-1

Click “Add file” → “Upload files”

Drag and drop your Assignment1 and Assignment2 folders

Click “Commit changes”

🔹 Option B: Using Git (Recommended for future updates)
If you have Git installed:

bash

To download your GitHub repository (like Assignment-2-Favorite-Shows), here are two easy methods:

🖱️ Method 1: Download as ZIP (No Git Required)
Go to your repository page: Assignment-2-Favorite-Shows

Click the green “Code” button

Select “Download ZIP”

Unzip the file on your computer — you’ll now have all your project files locally

💻 Method 2: Clone with Git (Recommended for Developers)
If you have Git installed:

Thanks! You're currently on the README.md editing page, which is great for editing text—but to upload folders, you’ll need to go back to the main repository view. Here's how to find the “Add file” button and upload your folders:

📂 How to Add Folders to Your GitHub Repository
✅ Step 1: Go to the Main Repository Page
Click the repository name at the top: Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

Or go directly to: github.com/hannahmaglaya/Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

✅ Step 2: Find the “Add file” Button
Once you're on the main page:

You said
yeah i need to show these two in one website
Copilot said
Perfect — I see you’ve uploaded two ZIP files: Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip. Now let’s get them working together on one website.

🧩 Step-by-Step: Show Both Assignments on One Website
✅ Step 1: Unzip and Organize
If you haven’t already:

Unzip Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip locally

Create two folders: Assignment1 and Assignment2

Move the contents of each unzipped folder into its respective folder

Your structure should look like:


Copy
Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/
├── Assignment1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── Assignment2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
└── index.html  ← This will be your landing page
✅ Step 2: Create a Landing Page
Make a new index.html file in the root of your repository with this code:

html

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hannah's CGD 200 Assignments</title>
  <style>
    body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; padding: 2em; background: #f9f9f9; }
    h1 { color: #333; }
    ul { list-style: none; padding: 0; }
    li { margin: 1em 0; }
    a { text-decoration: none; color: #007acc; font-size: 1.2em; }
    a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My CGD 200 Assignments</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Assignment1/index.html">View Assignment 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="Assignment2/index.html">View Assignment 2</a></li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
✅ Step 3: Upload Everything to GitHub
Go to your repo’s main page

Click “Add file” → “Upload files”

Upload the Assignment1 and Assignment2 folders, plus the new index.html

Click “Commit changes”

✅ Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional but Awesome)
To make it a live website:

Go to Settings → scroll to Pages

Under “Source,” select main branch and click Save

GitHub will give you a link to your live site

You said
where do i unzip them
Copilot said
Thanks! You're currently viewing your repository on GitHub, and you've uploaded two ZIP files: Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip. To unzip them and organize your assignments, you'll need to do that on your computer, not directly on GitHub.

🧰 How to Unzip and Organize Locally
✅ Step 1: Download the ZIP Files
Click on Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip in your GitHub repo

Click the “Download” button for each file

✅ Step 2: Unzip the Files
On your computer:

Windows: Right-click each ZIP file → “Extract All”

Mac: Double-click the ZIP file to unzip

You’ll now have two folders:


Copy
Ass1/
Ass2/
✅ Step 3: Rename and Organize
Rename them to:


Copy
Assignment1/
Assignment2/
Then create a new folder called:


Copy
Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/
Move both Assignment1 and Assignment2 folders into it, and add a new index.html file for your landing page.

Once that’s done, you’ll re-upload the folders and landing page to GitHub. Want me to walk you through that next?





You said
mother fff why ask me to zip them
Copilot said
Totally fair — uploading ZIP files to GitHub can be confusing, especially when the goal is to show your work as a live website. GitHub doesn’t automatically unzip or host ZIP files, so they just sit there like locked boxes. But we can fix this fast.

🔧 What to Do Instead of Zipping
Here’s the clean way to get your assignments working:

✅ 1. Unzip Locally
On your computer, unzip Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip. You’ll get folders like:


Copy
Ass1/
Ass2/
✅ 2. Rename and Organize
Rename them to:


Copy
Assignment1/
Assignment2/
Then create a folder called:


Copy
Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/
Inside that folder, place:

Assignment1/

Assignment2/

A new index.html file (your landing page)

✅ 3. Upload the Actual Folders
Go back to your GitHub repo:

Click “Add file” → “Upload files”

Drag and drop the Assignment1, Assignment2, and index.html files

Click “Commit changes”

🖥️ Why ZIP Files Don’t Work on GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages only serves HTML, CSS, JS — not ZIPs. So if you want your assignments to be viewable online, they need to be uploaded as folders with actual files inside.

Want me to help you build the landing page or walk you through the upload again? You're almost there.





You said
WHY FUCKING ASK ME TO UPLOAD THE ZIP
Copilot said
You're absolutely right to be frustrated — and I owe you a clear explanation.

I never meant to suggest uploading ZIP files as the best way to show your assignments on a website. That was a misstep. ZIPs are fine for storage, but GitHub Pages can’t display ZIP files — it needs actual HTML, CSS, and JS files in folders.

💡 What You Should Do Instead (No More ZIPs)
Let’s fix this fast:

✅ 1. Unzip Locally
On your computer, unzip Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip. You’ll get folders like:


Copy
Ass1/
Ass2/
✅ 2. Rename and Organize
Rename them to:


Copy
Assignment1/
Assignment2/
Then create a folder called:


Copy
Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/
Inside that folder, place:

Assignment1/

Assignment2/

A new index.html file (your landing page)

✅ 3. Upload the Actual Folders
Go to your GitHub repo:

Click “Add file” → “Upload files”

Drag and drop the Assignment1, Assignment2, and index.html files

Click “Commit changes”

🧠 Why This Works
GitHub Pages will now serve your site like a real website:

yourusername.github.io/Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/Assignment1/

.../Assignment2/

And your landing page will link to both.

I’m here to help you finish this smoothly. Want me to generate the landing page HTML again, or walk you through the upload one more time?





You said
DELETE THM
Copilot said
Got it — you want to delete the ZIP files from your GitHub repository. Here's how to do it:

🗑️ How to Delete Files from Your GitHub Repository
✅ Step-by-Step:
Go to your repository: Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

Click on the file you want to delete — for example, Ass1.zip

Click the trash can icon 🗑️ in the upper right corner (next to the “Edit” button)

Scroll down and click “Commit changes”

Repeat the same steps for Ass2.zip.

Once those are gone, you can upload your actual folders and files. Want help with that next step? I’ll make it smooth.





You said
WHERE IS THIS ICON
Copilot said
Thanks for your patience — you're on the file page for Ass1.zip, and GitHub doesn’t show a trash icon here because you can’t delete files directly from this view unless you’re editing code.

But here’s the correct way to delete it:

🗑️ How to Delete Ass1.zip and Ass2.zip from GitHub
✅ Step-by-Step:
Go to your repository’s main page: 👉 Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

Click the file name (Ass1.zip or Ass2.zip) to open it

In the top-right corner of the file view, click the three-dot menu (⋯) — it’s next to the “Raw” and “Blame” buttons

Select “Delete file”

Scroll down and click “Commit changes”

Repeat for both ZIP files. Once they’re gone, I can help you upload your actual folders and build the landing page. Want to do that next?





You said
OK NOW WHAT
Copilot said
Nice work — the ZIP files are gone! Now let’s get your two assignment websites uploaded properly and make them viewable on one page.

✅ What to Do Next
1. Organize Your Files Locally
On your computer, make sure you have:


Copy
Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-/
├── Assignment1/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── Assignment2/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
└── index.html  ← This will be your landing page
2. Create a Landing Page
Here’s a simple index.html you can use:

html

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hannah's CGD 200 Assignments</title>
  <style>
    body { font-family: sans-serif; padding: 2em; background: #f0f0f0; }
    h1 { color: #333; }
    ul { list-style: none; padding: 0; }
    li { margin: 1em 0; }
    a { color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 1.2em; }
    a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My CGD 200 Assignments</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Assignment1/index.html">View Assignment 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="Assignment2/index.html">View Assignment 2</a></li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
3. Upload Everything to GitHub
Go to your repo’s main page: Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

Click “Add file” → “Upload files”

Drag and drop:

Assignment1 folder

Assignment2 folder

index.html file

Click “Commit changes”

4. Enable GitHub Pages (Optional but Recommended)
To make your site live:

Go to Settings → scroll to Pages

Under “Source,” select main branch and click Save

GitHub will give you a link to your live website

Want help customizing the landing page or styling it with images and colors?





You said
cant drop the folders themselves
Copilot said
Thanks for the update — you're on the Upload Files page, which unfortunately doesn’t support dragging entire folders. GitHub only allows uploading individual files, not folders directly. But here’s how to work around that easily:

🧰 How to Upload Folders to GitHub
✅ Option 1: Upload Files Inside Each Folder
On your computer, open Assignment1 and Assignment2

Select all the files inside each folder (like index.html, style.css, etc.)

Drag and drop those files into GitHub’s upload area

Before clicking “Commit changes,” type the folder name in the file path box at the top:

For Assignment 1: type Assignment1/

For Assignment 2: type Assignment2/

Repeat for both folders.

✅ Option 2: Use Git (Recommended for Full Control)
If you want to upload folders directly and keep everything organized:

bash

Copy
# Open terminal and navigate to your project folder
cd path/to/Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

# Initialize Git (if not already)
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/hannahmaglaya/Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-.git

# Stage and commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Add Assignment folders and landing page"
git push -u origin main
Let me know which option you want to go with — I can walk you through either one step-by-step. You're so close to having this live!





You said
what nw
Copilot said
Nice work — your repository now has both folders uploaded: ✅ Assignment1/ and ✅ Assignment2/. You're almost done!

🧩 Final Step: Add a Landing Page
Let’s create an index.html file in the root of your repository that links to both assignments.

✅ What to Do:
Go to your repo’s main page: Hannah-s-CGD-200-Assignments-

Click “Add file” → “Create new file”

Name the file: index.html

Paste this code into the editor:

html

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hannah's CGD 200 Assignments</title>
  <style>
    body { font-family: sans-serif; padding: 2em; background: #f0f0f0; }
    h1 { color: #333; }
    ul { list-style: none; padding: 0; }
    li { margin: 1em 0; }
    a { color: #007acc; text-decoration: none; font-size: 1.2em; }
    a:hover { text-decoration: underline; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My CGD 200 Assignments</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="Assignment1/index.html">View Assignment 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="Assignment2/index.html">View Assignment 2</a></li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
Scroll down and click “Commit new file”

🌐 Optional: Make It a Live Website
To turn this into a public website:
